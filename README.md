```

#### Create Incento SDK instance

```dart
var options = {

    "coupon_code": "###-###-####",
"category": "YOUR_PRODUCT_CATEGORY",
"uid": "UNIQUE_UID"
  };
```

## Features

1. Easy and seamless integration of coupon codes
2. Simple UI to display all available coupons
3. Obtain API_KEY to get started.

## Getting started

Users can get the API_KEY after registration of their company on our portal . The same API_KEY can be used for further usage of this package.

## Usage

There are two ways to get started:

1. Using the provided built-in widget Coupons to access list of available coupons as per your API_KEY
2. Using a user-defined voucher code and calling in the (verify) and (redeem) methods along with your payment service

The handlers would be defined somewhere as

```dart

 Future<Map<String, dynamic>> verify(Map<String, dynamic> options) async {
    // To be called when coupon code needs to be verified
 }

Future<Map<String, dynamic>> redeem(Map<String, dynamic> options) async {
    // To be called when coupon code needs to be redeemed
 }

MyCoupons() // To be called when list of available coupons need to be displayed

```
